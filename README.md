This is a DiscordBot which tries to give you random facts by working with several APIs! \n
It can also help you moderating your Discord Server via different commands such as .ban or . clear xx.\n
It is a project of one person (bjarnetoString) thats why it is developt pretty slowly :)\n
If you want to contribute just let me know.\n
A list of all commands that can be used will be availible soon. Have fun.\n
By the way: the Bot will be hosted on a web server for 24/7 accesibility.
